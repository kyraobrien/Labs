       <p>Fall is now in full swing and with a new season comes new trends. From my favorite wardrobe essentials, to my coffee order, here are a few of my must haves this season.</p>
       <h2>And More!</h2>

       <p>I love any fall drink, but the Starbucks Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew is a go-to every fall. I love that it's not overly sweet. I add a touch of oatmilk for an extra creaminess.</p>
       
       <li><h3>Gold+Ivy Candles</h3></li><!--Move closing </li> to line 30. -->
       <img src="images/gold+ivy.webp" alt="gold+ivy" width="300">
       <p>I'm convinced that <a href="https://goldandivy.com/">Gold+Ivy</a> doesnt have a candle scent that I dont like. They have a few fall scents from "Bourbon Apple Cider" to "Maple Chai". All of the candles are free of toxins and have an amazing burn! I recommend this company all the time! </p>
       
       <li><h3>Self-Improvement Book</h3></li><!--Move closing </li> to line 34. -->

       <p>I just recently got the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essays-That-Will-Change-Think/dp/1945796065">"101 Essays That Will Change The Way You Think"</a> by Brianna Wiest and so far I've really enjoyed reading this! </p>
