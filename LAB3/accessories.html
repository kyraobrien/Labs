       <p>Fall is now in full swing and with a new season comes new trends. From my favorite wardrobe essentials, to my coffee order, here are a few of my must haves this season.</p>
       <h2>Must Have Accessories</h2>
       <ul>
       <li><h3>Gold Chunky Hoops</h3></li>

       <p>I have owned a pair of classic chunky gold hoops for over 3 years now and I'm still always reaching for them when I get ready. These paired with other gold jewlery will tie together any look! I swear by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thick-Earrings-Statement-Stainless-Plated/dp/B07G856QYZ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3M89I9KQBT818&keywords=chunky+gold+hoops+wowshow&qid=1694918898&s=apparel&sprefix=chunky+bold+hoops+wowshow%2Cfashion-womens-jewelry%2C116&sr=1-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1">this</a> affordable pair from Amazon.  </p>

       <p>Even though summer is coming to an end, the sun is still shining many days of fall! Dont ditch the sunglasses just yet! <a href="https://www.freepeople.com/shop/luna-classic-aviator-sunglasses/?color=020&countryCode=US&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI27fb086wgQMVrimzAB2UlAptEAQYAiABEgKLOfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&inventoryCountry=US&utm_kxconfid=vx6ro62gj&type=REGULAR&size=One%20Size&quantity=1">These</a> sunglasses are so cute and can add some class to an outfit.</p>
       <br>
       <li><h3>Leather Fanny Pack</h3></li>
       <img src="images/fannypack.webp" alt="fannypack" width="300">
       <p>I got this fanny pack during the summer and have worn it almost everyday! I will continue to wear this throughout the fall to hold my essentials when I'm on the go. The warm color of the leather is perfect for fall. I got the <a href="https://mandrn.com/collections/leather-fanny-pack/products/woven-remy-tan-leather-fanny-pack">Woven Remy bag</a> in "Tan".</p>
